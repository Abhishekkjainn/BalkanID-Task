## ‚ú® Project Highlights & Features

This project fulfills all core requirements of the capstone task and goes further by implementing several **bonus features** to enhance functionality, security, and user experience.

### Core Features Implemented
* **üóÇÔ∏è Efficient Storage with Deduplication**: Employs SHA-256 content hashing to ensure that identical files are only stored once, with a reference counting system to manage ownership and deletions. This provides significant storage savings, which are tracked and displayed to the user.
* **üöÄ Advanced File Uploads**: A modern, responsive UI supporting single, multiple, and **drag-and-drop** file uploads. The system performs both client-side and server-side MIME type validation to prevent content mismatches.
* **ü§ù Powerful Sharing Capabilities**:
    * **Public Sharing**: Generate a public link for any file, making it accessible to anyone.
    * **Private Sharing**: Share files directly and securely with other registered users on the platform.
* **üîç Advanced Search & Filtering**: A powerful, multi-filter search engine allowing users to query files by filename, MIME type, size range, and date range.
* **üìä Storage Analytics**: A dedicated analytics dashboard for users to visualize their storage usage, including a clear breakdown of savings achieved through deduplication.
* **üñ•Ô∏è Admin Panel**: An administrative dashboard providing a system-wide view of all files, user details, and download statistics.

### üèÜ Bonus Features & Enhancements
* **‚òÅÔ∏è Full Cloud Deployment**: The entire application stack is deployed on modern cloud infrastructure: **Vercel** for the frontend, **Render** for the backend Go API, and **Supabase** for the PostgreSQL database.
* **üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A robust RBAC system is implemented, distinguishing between `user` and `admin` roles to secure administrative endpoints.
* **üìú Comprehensive Audit Logs**: The system records all critical file activities (upload, download, share, delete), providing a complete audit trail for user actions.
* **üìÑ In-Browser PDF Previews**: Users can preview `.pdf` files directly within the application, enhancing convenience and workflow.
* **üìà Real-Time Upload Progress**: The frontend provides a visual progress bar during uploads, offering a superior user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

The architecture is designed for scalability and maintainability, leveraging a modern, production-ready tech stack.

| Category      | Technology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend** | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-00ADD8?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white" alt="Go"/> <br/> Chosen for its high performance, concurrency, and static typing, making it ideal for building a fast and reliable backend API.                               |
| **Frontend** | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB" alt="React"/> <br/> Selected for its component-based architecture and vast ecosystem, enabling a modern, fully responsive, and maintainable user interface.                                    |
| **Database** | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white" alt="PostgreSQL"/> <br/> A powerful relational database managed via **Supabase**, chosen for its reliability and robust support for data integrity.                                    |
| **Deployment**| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white" alt="Docker"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Vercel-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&logoColor=white" alt="Vercel"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Render-46E3B7?style=for-the-badge&logo=render&logoColor=white" alt="Render"/> <br/> Fully containerized with Docker for consistent local development and deployed globally. |

## üì¶ Database Schema

The database is structured to support the application's features efficiently, with a clear separation between user file metadata and the physical, deduplicated file records.

*The complete schema and migration files are version-controlled and located in the `/supabase/migrations` directory.*

## üöÄ Getting Started: Local Development

The entire application stack can be run locally with a single command using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

* [Go (v1.20+)](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* [Node.js (v18+)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Abhishekkjainn/BalkanID-Task.git](https://github.com/Abhishekkjainn/BalkanID-Task.git)
cd BalkanID-Task
````

### 2\. Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env` files for both the backend and frontend by copying the provided `.env.example` files.

**Backend (`backend/.env`):**

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Update `backend/.env` with your local PostgreSQL connection string and a unique JWT secret.

**Frontend (`frontend/keyvia/.env`):**

```bash
cp frontend/keyvia/.env.example frontend/keyvia/.env
```

The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is already configured for local development.

### 3\. Run with Docker Compose

From the **root directory** of the project, run the following command to build and start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The services will be available at:

  * **Frontend (React App)**: `http://localhost:5173`
  * **Backend (Go API)**: `http://localhost:8080`
